# Overview

In this project, I developed a simple Pong game using Pygame. If you have never played, the game features two paddles and a ball that players control to score points against each other. The objective is to hit the ball with the paddles in a way that the opposing player cannot successfully return it.

The purpose of creating this software was to enhance my skills as a software engineer and gain practical experience in game development. Developing a game like Pong allowed me to delve into interactive graphics, user input handling, collision detection, and game loop control.
